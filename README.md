Introduction:
The Order Management System is a simple C++ program designed to manage and display customer orders. The program uses structures to represent items and orders, allowing users to input customer information, item details, and then generates a comprehensive order summary, including total price, VAT (Value Added Tax), and the overall amount.

Description:
The program is divided into two main structures: `Item` and `Order`. The `Item` structure contains information about the name and price of a particular item. The `Order` structure aggregates customer details and a vector of items. The program calculates the total price, VAT, and the final amount for the order.

The main function collects customer information, the number of items in the order, and iteratively gathers details for each item. After gathering input, the program displays a detailed order summary, including individual item prices, total price (excluding VAT), VAT amount, and the final total amount.

Project Features:
1. Customer Information Input: Allows users to input customer name and order details.
2. Dynamic Item Input: Accommodates a dynamic number of items with user-specified names and prices.
3. VAT Calculation: Implements a VAT rate of 10% to calculate the VAT amount on the total price.
4. Detailed Order Display: Presents a well-formatted order summary, including itemized details and the final amount.

Advantages:
1. User-Friendly: The program is easy to use, with a step-by-step process for entering customer and item details.
2. Customizable: Adapts to different order sizes, allowing flexibility for various business scenarios.
3. Transparent Pricing: Displays a detailed breakdown of costs, enhancing transparency for both customers and business owners.
4. Educational: Serves as an educational tool for learning C++ programming, data structures, and basic input/output operations.

Benefits:
1. Efficiency: Streamlines the order management process by automating calculations and order display.
2. Accuracy: Reduces the risk of manual calculation errors, ensuring accurate VAT and total amount calculations.
3. Versatility: Can be easily adapted and extended for more complex order management systems in real-world applications.
4. Cost Transparency: Enhances business-client relationships by providing a clear overview of pricing components.

Conclusion:
The Order Management System project in C++ provides a foundation for more advanced order processing systems. It demonstrates key programming concepts and serves as a practical tool for businesses seeking a straightforward order management solution. The transparency in pricing and adaptability make it a valuable resource for both beginners learning C++ and businesses looking for a customizable order management framework.
